Develop two aspects of the user experience design for a hypothetical app for which the assignments in this class could be the basis.  Remember that the user experience design focuses on the user experience, not on the technology used to achieve that experience.

<strong>Part 1: Persona Design </strong>

Give a persona design for the archetypal user of your app.  As explained in the lectures, a persona design should include a portrait of this user, including a photograph to personalize them (the photograph should not be of you or some famous personality)

<strong>Part 2: Context Scenario </strong>

Give a “day in the life” scenario for the user of your app, revealing contact points where the app is part of their experience.  The scenario should include communication with other users via messaging, the organization of this communication into conversations, the exchange of location (GPS) information in this communication, and the use of maps to organize this location information.  Again, your scenario should not mention how the app achieves what it is supposed to do, “magical thinking” is okay at this point in the design.  You should be clear about what forms of user goals the app is attempting to achieve.

Your document should be uploaded as a PDF document, approximately two pages (one for each part of the specification).  Your solution should be uploaded via the Canvas classroom.
